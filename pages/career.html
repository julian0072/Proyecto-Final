            <strong>Jhonn</strong> is a digital artist and sculptor, whose work
            addresses technology’s failure to capture the unstable human body.
            <br />
            He grew up in Melbourne, Australia, and now lives and works in
            Brooklyn, New York. <br />
            He earned a BA (Hons) in Fine Art/History of Art at Goldsmiths
            College, University of London; a Graduate Certificate in Spatial
            Information Architecture from RMIT University, Melbourne; and an MFA
            in Art and Technology Studies at the School of the Art Institute of
            Chicago. Jhonn is the co-host of the YouTube channel File Exchange,
            and serves as a mentor with NewInc. <br />
            Past residencies include the Museum of Arts and Design, New York;
            Pioneer Works, Brooklyn; and the Elizabeth Foundation for the Arts,
            New York. Jhonn has exhibited her artwork in New York, Los Angeles,
            London, Paris, Sydney, Tokyo, Osaka and Seoul. <br />
            His video work has been screened in festivals including
            Transmediale, Zero1 San Jose Biennial, Dance Camera West,
            Trampoline, Frequency, Currents New Media Festival and the Japan
            Media Arts Festival. Sophie has taught in the Department of Digital
            Arts at Pratt Institute as a Visiting Associate Professor, and at
            Columbia College, Chicago, as a visiting instructor. <br />
            Recent exhibitions include Transfigured at C24 Gallery in New York,
            Out of Body: Sculpture Post-Photography at bitforms gallery, New
            York, and Machines for Suffering (solo) at Bannister Gallery, Rhode
            Island College, RI. Her work has been supported by the Australia
            Council for the Arts, the Experimental Media and Performing Arts
            Center at Rensselaer Polytechnic, and other private funding bodies.
            Her work is held in public and private collections in the United
            States and internationally. <br />
            She is a New York Foundation for the Arts Digital and Electronic
            Arts Fellow. Recent online exhibitions include Dematerialized with
            SVA, In The Bardo: Unpacking the Real on FeralFile and Synthetic
            Corporeality with Meet Digital Culture Centre, Milan.

            Jhonns work investigates the complexity, and the poetics, of
            capturing the female-identified body in the digital age. She uses a
            3D laser scanner to create sculptures, prints, video and VR/AR
            artworks. This scanner was never designed to capture the human body
            in motion--when confronted with a moving form, the machine receives
            conflicting spatial coordinates and generates incomplete images.
            Kahn converts this deliberately damaged data into the form of
            prints, videos and hand-painted, 3D printed sculptures. Her
            fragmented forms draw inspiration from funereal and memorial
            sculpture, and can read as faux-historical forgeries and/or
            contemporary relics. The psychological underpinnings of Kahn’s work
            are based upon the artist’s personal history of chronic illness and
            disability. Looking through the lens of medical history, Kahn
            examines significant moments (e.g. the ‘invention’ of hysteria at
            the Salpetriere asylum) where older technologies like photography
            similarly failed to capture the female-identified body and its
            attendant madnesses. For her sculpture and print series Machines for
            Suffering, Kahn 3D scanned dancers as they re-enacted the supposed
            choreography of an attack of hysteria. These works suggest an
            unstable, monumental, body-as-architecture, under continuous
            construction -- or perhaps demolition. Kahn looks to her early
            training as a photographer to amplify the eeriness of creating
            digital duplications of the human body within the space of the
            virtual. His most recent series, The Divers, was created with Butoh
            performers at Pioneer Works, and features weightless body/avatars
            rendered in a 3D digital void. It echoes the monochrome transparency
            of Victorian spirit photography, and the vernacular language of
            tombstones. These images speak to the inherent deathliness of 3D
            replications of the digital body, and suggest the separation of body
            and digital avatar as an almost religious operation. In all her
            works, the human body is de-materialized, separated from the
            physical, and then re-materialized into a vastly altered form. Like
            many of his contemporaries who also use 3D software and fabrication
            tools ‘against the grain’, Kahn is interested in situating these
            modes of seeing within a critical context. Subsequently, the artist
            challenges standard viewpoints by creating her own subjective,
            embodied and very human way of seeing through a technological lens.
